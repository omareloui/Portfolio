## Technical questions

- What are the payload of the auth token should have? (Scopes and Subjects)

<Details>
1. Issuer (iss): The entity that issued the token.

1. Subject (sub): Unique identifier for the user or entity the token belongs to.

1. Scopes (scope): Permissions granted by the token.

1. Audience (aud): The intended recipient of the token.

1. Expiration Time (exp): Timestamp when the token expires.

1. Issued At (iat): Timestamp when the token was issued.

1. Not Before (nbf): Timestamp before which the token isn't valid.
</Details>

## Problem Solving

1. You have an array with a size of n. It's filled with 1 to n-1. It has a
   duplicate element. How to know this element?

```go title="get-duplicate.go"
func GetDuplicate(arr []int) {
   shouldSumTo := 0
   actualSum := 0

   for i, v := range arr {
      shouldSumTo += i+1
      actualSum += v
   }

   return shouldSumTo - actualSum
}
```

1. You have 2 numbers, switch them without creating a new variable

```go title="swap-in-place.go"
a := 4
b := 6

// Their solution
a := a + b // 10

b := a - b // 4
a := a - b // 6

// My solution
a := a ^ b // 010 ^ 110 = 100

b := a ^ b // 100 ^ 110 = 010
a := a ^ b // 100 ^ 010 = 110
```

## Database and SQL

- You have students, courses, and teachers. Design a database for this.
- Write an SQL query to fetch all the teacher's students.
