## Technical Backend Questions

### Explain how you would implement idempotency in a payment API to prevent duplicate transactions

<Details>  
 To implement idempotency in a payment API:

1.  Generate Unique Key: Assign a unique identifier (e.g., UUID) to each
    payment request.
2.  Store Key & Result: Store the key and the payment result in a persistent
    storage (e.g., database, cache).
3.  Handle Subsequent Requests: If a request with the same key arrives: - Retrieve the stored result. - Return the stored result to the client, avoiding duplicate processing.

### How would you handle distributed transactions across multiple microservices

<Details>
1.  Two-Phase Commit (2PC)

**Concept:** A classic approach where a coordinator coordinates the transaction
across multiple participants. Phase 1 (Prepare): The coordinator sends a
"prepare" message to all participants. Each participant checks if it can commit
and responds with "ready" or "abort."

**Phase 2 (Commit/Rollback):** If all participants are "ready," the coordinator
sends a "commit" message to all participants. If any participant is "not ready"
or the coordinator receives an abort response, it sends a "rollback" message to
all participants.

1.  Saga Pattern

**Concept:** A series of local transactions, each compensating for the effects
of the previous one in case of failure. Each microservice performs its local
transaction and publishes an event. Subsequent microservices listen to these
events and perform their own transactions. If a failure occurs, a series of
compensating transactions are executed in reverse order to undo the effects of
the previous transactions.

1.  Event Sourcing

**Concept:** Every change to the application state is captured as an event.
These events are stored in an append-only log.

1.  Message Queues with Transactions

**Concept:** Utilize message queues with transactional capabilities. Publish
messages to a queue within a transaction. Â  Consumers acknowledge messages
only after successful completion of their local transactions. If a consumer
fails, the message is typically redelivered.
</Details>

### What strategies would you use to optimize database performance for large-scale financial transactions

<Details>
**1. Data Modeling and Schema Design:**

- **Normalization:** Properly normalize your database to reduce data
  redundancy and improve data integrity. However, consider denormalization
  for frequently joined tables to improve query performance.

**State Management Approach for Large-Scale Applications**

In large-scale applications, effective state management is crucial for
maintainability, scalability, and performance. Here's a general approach:

1.  **Identify State Needs:**
    - **Local State:** State specific to a component (e.g., form input values,
      component visibility).
    - **Shared State:** State shared across multiple components (e.g., user
      authentication, application settings, shopping cart).
2.  **Choose the Right Tools:**
    - **Context API:** Suitable for:
      - Simple state sharing within a limited component tree.
      - Sharing small pieces of data.
      - Avoiding prop drilling.
    - **Redux:** Ideal for:
      - Complex applications with deeply nested components.
      - Large teams working on the same codebase.
      - Applications requiring predictable state updates and a single source
        of truth.
      - Advanced features like time travel debugging and state persistence.
3.  **Design and Structure:**
    - **Centralized Store:** If using Redux, create a central store to hold
      the application's state.
    - **Actions:** Define actions as plain JavaScript objects that describe
      the intent to change the state.
    - **Reducers:** Pure functions that take the current state and an action
      as input and return a new state.
    - **Selectors:** Create reusable functions to extract specific parts of
      the state.
4.  **Performance Optimization:**
    - **Memoization:** Use `useMemo` and `React.memo` to avoid unnecessary
      re-renders.
    - **Data Normalization:** Normalize data to reduce redundancy and improve
      performance.

```javascript
import * as yup from "yup";

const schema = yup.object().shape({
  amount: yup.number().required("Amount is required").positive("Amount must be positive"),
  accountNumber: yup
    .string()
    .required("Account number is required")
    .matches(/^\d{10}$/, "Invalid account number format"),
});

const handleSubmit = async values => {
  try {
    await schema.validate(values, { abortEarly: false });
    // ... Submit the form data to the server
  } catch (errors) {
    // Handle validation errors
    setErrors(errors.inner.reduce((acc, err) => ({ ...acc, [err.path]: err.message }), {}));
  }
};
```

## Security (Critical for Fintech)

### How do you handle sensitive payment information securely

<Details>
**1. Encryption:**

- **Data in Transit:** Utilize Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure
  Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt data while it's being transmitted between
  your website/app and the payment processor. This ensures that data is
  unreadable during transit.
- **Data at Rest:** If you must store any payment data (which is generally
  discouraged), encrypt it using strong encryption algorithms like AES-256.

**2. Tokenization:**

- Replace sensitive data (like credit card numbers) with unique tokens.
- Store only the tokens, not the actual card details.
- This significantly reduces the impact of a data breach as attackers cannot
  obtain actual card information.

**3. Payment Gateways:**

- **Utilize reputable payment gateways:** These services handle the majority
  of the security burden, including encryption, tokenization, and fraud
  detection.
- **PCI DSS Compliance:** Ensure the payment gateway and your own systems
  comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

**4. Strong Authentication:**

- **Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA):** Require customers to
  provide two or more forms of identification (e.g., password + one-time
  code) to enhance security.
- **Address Verification System (AVS):** Verify the billing address provided
  by the customer with the address on file with the card issuer.

**5. Regular Security Audits and Monitoring:**

- **Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests:** Identify and
  address vulnerabilities in your systems.
- **Monitor transaction activity for suspicious patterns:** This can help
  detect fraudulent activity.

**6. Employee Training:**

- **Train employees on security best practices:** This includes handling
  sensitive data, recognizing phishing attempts, and adhering to security
  protocols.

**7. Minimize Data Storage:**

- **Avoid storing sensitive data whenever possible:** If you must store data,
  store only the minimum necessary information and for the shortest possible
  time.

**8. Regular Software Updates:**

- **Keep all software (operating systems, applications, and libraries)
  up-to-date:** This helps patch security vulnerabilities.

**Key Considerations:**

- **PCI DSS Compliance:** Adherence to PCI DSS is crucial for businesses that
  handle card data.
- **Data Minimization:** Only collect and store the absolute minimum amount
  of sensitive data.
- **Regular Security Reviews:** Continuously review and update your security
  measures to address evolving threats.

By following these practices, you can significantly enhance the security of
your payment processing systems and protect your customers' sensitive
information.

<Details>
**1. Acknowledge and Track Technical Debt**

- **Identify and Categorize:** Regularly identify and categorize technical
  debt (e.g., code smells, design flaws, missing tests). Tools like SonarQube
  can help.
- **Prioritize:** Prioritize debt based on impact (e.g., risk of failure,
  maintainability, future development costs). Use a system like MoSCoW method
  (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have).

**2. Allocate Time for Refactoring**

- **Dedicated Sprints/Cycles:** Allocate specific sprints or a percentage of
  each sprint to address technical debt.
- **"Tech Debt Days":** Dedicate specific days or weeks to focus solely on
  refactoring and improving code quality.

**3. Integrate Debt Repayment into Feature Development**

- **"Pay as you go":** Address small debts as they arise during feature
  development.
- **Refactor alongside new features:** When working on a feature, refactor
  related areas to improve maintainability.

**4. Communicate and Collaborate**

- **Transparency:** Be transparent with stakeholders about the existence and
  impact of technical debt.
- **Team buy-in:** Ensure the entire team understands the importance of
  addressing technical debt.
- **Regular Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews to identify and address
  potential issues early on.

**5. Prevent Future Debt**

- **Code Reviews:** Implement strict code review processes to catch issues
  before they become major problems.
- **Automated Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and
  end-to-end tests to catch regressions early.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** Automate the build,
  test, and deployment process to quickly identify and address issues.
- **Invest in Training:** Invest in training and development for developers
  to improve their coding skills and best practices.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Balance:** Find a balance between delivering new features and addressing
  technical debt.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly evaluate and refine your strategies
  for managing technical debt.
