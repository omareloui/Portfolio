## Technical Questions

- Why MongoDB over SQL.

- What is the interceptor in NestJS.

## Problem Solving

### Problem #1

Given an array of integer numbers sorted in ascending order, find the starting
and ending position of a given target value. If target is not found in the
array, return `[-1, -1]`. Could you write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime
complexity?

> #### Example 1
>
> Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,8,10], target = 8
>
> Output: [3,4]
>
> #### Example 2
>
> Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
>
> Output: [-1,-1]

<Details summary="Show answer">

Binary search the required int. Then move from there, move to the right of
found element until you find a diff int. Then do the same for the left.

### Problem #2

Given an integer array of numbers sorted in ascending order, return an array of
the squares of each number sorted in an ascending order. Could you write an
algorithm with `O(n)` runtime complexity?

> #### Example 1
>
> Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
>
> Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
>
> Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
>
> After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
>
> #### Example 2
>
> Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
>
> Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

<Details>

The negative numbers will always be first. Square the negative numbers and
store the result in a new array until you reach a zero or a positive number.
This will we'll have the squared numbers in reverse order.

> Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
>
> Squared Negative Numbers Array: [16,1]

Then we'll do something like in *Merge Sort*. We'll have a pointer that starts
form the end of the squared negative numbers array. With each positive number
we'll check if the current value of the pointer is less than the square of the
current number. If so, add it first and then add the square of the positive
number.

```plaintext
one iteration after setting the negative numbers:

Input: nums = [-5,-1,0,3,10]
                     ^
Squared Negative Numbers Array: [16,1]
                                    ^
Result: [0]

One iteration after:

Input: nums = [-5,-1,0,3,10]
                       ^
Squared Negative Numbers Array: [16,1]
                                    ^
Result: [0,1,9]

Input: nums = [-5,-1,0,3,10]

                                 ^
Result: [0,1,9,10,16]
